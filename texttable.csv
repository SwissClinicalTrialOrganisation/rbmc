I. Participant,Vulnerable population,"These subjects may include children or teenagers, healthy volunteers, students, pregnant women, geriatric subjects (over 80 years), those with cognitive or psychological disorders, immigrants, prisoners, etc.",Impact: this depends on the study and type of vulnerable persons. E.g. a study with electronic questionnaires could be highly affected if the population is geriatric and is not familiar with using electronic devices (score = 3).,"Occurrence: e.g. if the study population is constituted of half adults and half children, the occurrence should be score = 2 (medium).","Detectability: this should be quite easy to detect, as the monitor has full access to the Informed Consent Form (ICF), (score = 1).",I_vuln
I. Participant,Emergency situation,"Consider if problems may occur with informed consent, assessment of eligibility criteria, immediate trial-related processes (such as diagnosis and therapy). “Emergency” is defined as necessity of immediate start of therapy (<12h), irrespective of the severity of the disorder.",Impact: this depends on the study design.,"Occurrence: e.g. if 100% of the study subjects are enrolled in emergency settings, the occurrence should be score = 3 (high).",Detectability: this should be fairly easy to detect as the monitor has full access to the ICF (score = 1).,I_emsit
I. Participant,Complexity of consent process,Consider if there are multiple ICFs (such as pre-screening or sub-studies).,"Impact: e.g. if a pre-screening consent is necessary, the impact should be score = 3 (high).","Occurrence: e.g. if 100% of the study subjects are supposed to be enrolled in sub-studies, the occurrence should be score = 3 (high).","Detectability: this should be fairly easy to detect, as the monitor has full access to the ICF (score = 1).",I_comp
II. Design,Complexity of eligibility criteria,"Consider the number of criteria, ability to verify them, critical criteria (safety-relevant, relevant for the effectiveness of the therapy, relevant for the validity of the results), population stratification, documentation required for diagnosis, central vs. local laboratory, timelines of assessment, special tests/assessments for eligibility evaluation not routinely performed, etc.","Impact: the more the eligibility criterion is related to the endpoint or subject’s safety/rights, the higher the score should be.",Occurrence: this depends on the number of complex criteria.,"Detectability: e.g. if the criterion concerns a medication taken by the subject over the past 20 years, then score = 3; if the medication was taken in the past 2 days, then score = 1 (easy to detect).",II_comp
II. Design,Complexity of design,"Consider number of arms, adaptive design, randomisation, number of visits, dose, complicated or unusual procedures, study duration, strict timing for certain procedures, number of sites or centres, etc. Is it likely that the subject/investigator will not adhere to the treatment schedule?",Impact: e.g. a study with an adaptive design should have a high impact on the subject’s safety (score = 3).,"Occurrence: e.g. in a study with two groups, one with a simple design, and the other with a complex design, score = 2 (medium).","Detectability: e.g. in a dose escalation design, this RF should be easy to detect (score = 1).",II_descomp
II. Design,Complexity of primary endpoint,"Consider the robustness of the endpoint (objective/subjective, soft), if its assessment is complex or not standard (e.g. composite endpoint), and if special requirements are needed for its assessment.",Impact: this should often be score = 3.,Occurrence: this should often be score = 3.,"Detectability: e.g. a composite primary endpoint should be score = 3, since each of its components could constitute a source of error. A primary endpoint obtained by imaging measurements should be score = 3, if special skills are required to verify it.",II_primcomp
II. Design,Bias impacting the primary endpoint,"Consider if there are any sources of bias or variance with regard to the endpoints. This can happen, for instance, if the trial is not randomised or is open label.","Impact: this depends on the design, e.g. for an unblinded study, in which the primary endpoint is the Physician Global Assessment (PGA), impact should be score = 3.","Occurrence: if bias is supposed to occur in 100% of the cases, this should be score = 3.",Detectability: this depends on the bias.,II_primbias
II. Design,Additional treatment for concomitant diseases/symptoms,"Consider if the study population is likely to receive additional treatment for concomitant diseases (with input from a medical doctor required), and if this could affect the (efficacy) endpoints.","Impact: this depends on the study, e.g. if the endpoint is pain level in a population with chronic pain conditions, additional treatment could have a strong impact on the quality of data (score = 3).","Occurrence: e.g. if 100% of the subjects are supposed to receive additional treatment, then score = 3.","Detectability: e.g. if the subjects use a lot of over-the-counter medications, this will be difficult to detect for the monitor (score = 3).",II_trtconcom
II. Design,Complexity of procedures,Consider unusual procedures.,"Impact: e.g. if the study implies a large number of visits lasting long hours with unusual procedures, this could burden the subject’s participation and the impact should be high (score = 3).",Occurrence: this should often be score = 3.,Detectability: this depends on the study.,II_proccomp
II. Design,Withdrawal/drop-outs,"Is there an increased risk of withdrawal or drop-out? E.g. might subjects withdraw from therapy or follow-up, as a result of very positive (or negative) therapeutic effects? Consider the possibility of noncompliance or withdrawal of consent. How is this taken into account in the trial design? In trials focusing on efficacy differences, drop-outs could bias the results. Consider subject compliance in case of self-treatment administration.","Impact: e.g. score = 3 if the study design could encourage a large number of withdrawal/drop-outs, except if their number is already included in the sample size calculation and is realistic, or if it is planned to replace withdrawal/drop-outs (then score = 1).",Occurrence: make an estimate.,Detectability: this should often be score = 1.,II_withdraw
III. Safety,Serious drug reaction/device effect,Consider if the trial therapeutic intervention is known to have any serious drug reaction/device effect. Have any events of special interest been identified? Consider any protocol-specific reporting requirements for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).,"Impact: e.g. this should be low (score = 1), if the Investigational Medical Product (IMP) is a marketed drug with a well-known safety profile.","Occurrence: make an estimate, according to actual knowledge.",Detectability: the score will depend on the depth of documentation of Adverse Events (AEs) in health data records.,III_reaction
III. Safety,Interactions,"Consider if there is a lack of previous experience on combination of trial therapeutic intervention being studied and other intervention/medications/devices. Pay particular attention to any basic or background therapies, prescribed, recommended, or allowed by the protocol, and to the timescale of potential interactions (see www.epocrates.com).",Impact: e.g. a study with two combined chemotherapies will have a higher impact on the subject’s safety.,"Occurrence: make an estimate, according to the pharmacokinetic profile of the IMP.",Detectability: this depends on the documentation of concomitant treatments in health data records.,III_interaction
III. Safety,Subject population’s conditions,"Consider if the subject population's condition is critically severe: potential for SAEs/subject risk, or complexity of disease state. Consider high WHO/ECOG scores (in oncological subjects).",Impact: this depends on the study.,Occurrence: the score should be high if the population is constituted of subjects with multiple ongoing diseases.,Detectability: this depends on the documentation of medical histories in health data records.,III_cond
"IV. Intervention (IMP, IMD, surgery, etc.)",Actual knowledge,"Consider if there is only very limited knowledge about at least one of the trial therapeutic interventions: experience of the sites, special logistic requirements, product stability and expiry dates, likelihood of serious drug reaction/device effect, relative to standard medical care.",Impact: e.g. a first-in-human study should be score = 3.,"Occurrence: e.g. in a study with two groups, one receiving the IMP, the other receiving a placebo, score = 2 (medium).",Detectability: this depends on the intervention.,IV_knowledge

"IV. Intervention (IMP, IMD, surgery, etc.)",Logistics,"Are there any essential/unusual storage, preparation, or destruction requirements for the IMP or Investigational Medical Device (IMD)? It is necessary to analyse whether non-compliance with the storage requirements will actually increase the risk. Are there other trials using the same IMP/IMD (and, if so, evaluate the risk of confusion)?",Impact: e.g. a study with IMP storage at 2 to -8°C should at least be score = 2.,Occurrence: this should often be score = 3.,Detectability: this should be quite easy to detect (score = 1).,IV_logisitics
"IV. Intervention (IMP, IMD, surgery, etc.)",Accidental or deliberate unblinding,"E.g. by obtaining laboratory values from a local laboratory, physical differences between placebo and verum, adverse events, unblinding of a subject for treatment decision after trial treatment, etc.","Impact: e.g. in a study testing placebo versus an IMP with frequent Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), the score should be = 3 (high).",Occurrence: this should often be score = 3.,Detectability: this depends on the study design.,IV_unblind
V. Management,Sites,"Are there enough staff? Qualified staff? Consider if the site or Principal Investigator (PI) is aware of their responsibilities (coordination/clarification of all issues/matters between the PI’s unit and other units at their hospital e.g. radiology department, laboratory, etc.).","Impact: e.g. in a monocentric study with a non-experienced site, score = 3.","Occurrence: the overall participation is evaluated here (0–20 % of all sites evaluated as problematic = low occurrence (score = 1); 21–40% of all sites evaluated as problematic = medium occurrence (score = 2); 41–100% of all sites evaluated as problematic = high occurrence, score = 3).","Detectability: this can be easily detected by checking training logs, etc., then score = 1.",V_sites
V. Management,Technical requirements,"Consider if there are any technical requirements for the trial sites, e.g. access to diagnostic equipment, emergency equipment, unusual assessments to be done locally, new assessment tools, any essential processing, transport and/or storage requirements for material samples (e.g. biological samples, bio-banking which would require a fridge, freezer, a -80°C freezer, centrifuges, etc.) Consider to what extent the incorrect handling of samples may be critical.","Impact: e.g. in a study sharing a hyperbaric chamber with clinical use, the impact should be high (score = 3).",Occurrence: this depends on the study design/intervention.,Detectability: this depends on the study design/intervention.,V_tech
